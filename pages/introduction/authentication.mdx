Sandbox API keys have the prefix `sk_test` and live API keys have the prefix `sk_live`.

**Your API keys are highly sensitive and provide full access to your platform and bureau data.** Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Authentication to the API is performed via Bearer auth. This requires setting the Authentication header, e.g. `-H "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_51MktQKLA3xH30J63kOdV0kAdOkV2KDBLQa6QD9mHJte3nSgzQaejxGo5Ub6qdl7DnCsStzsQfqilPgCXwy9yZkrp00jRlCwKbO"`

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
