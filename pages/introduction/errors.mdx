Slipstream uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. 

In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Slipstream's servers (these are rare).

Most `4xx` errors can be handled programmatically. The error response will include a code that briefly explains the error reported.

<ResponseExample>
```json 4xx
{
  "code": "request.validation.error",
  "message": "The firstname cannot be empty."
}
```

```json 5xx
{
  "code": "server.internal_server_error",
  "message": "Something went wrong on our end."
}
```
</ResponseExample>
