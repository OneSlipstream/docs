Slipstream uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. 

In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Slipstream's servers (these are rare).

Most `4xx` errors can be handled programmatically. The error response will include a [code](#) that briefly explains the error reported.
