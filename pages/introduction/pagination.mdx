All endpoints that list support pagination.

We utilize cursor based pagination via `startingAfter` and `endingBefore` parameters. 
Both parameters accept ID's of a given object (e.g.: [Consumer](/pages/api/consumers/create)) 
and return objects in inverse chronological order meaning the most recently created objects will be returned first.

The `startingAfter` and `endingBefore` parameters are mutually exclusive and cannot be set at the same time.

Additionally, you can set the `limit` parameter to limit the number of objects returned. The default limit is 10 and the maximum is 100.

Lastly, the response will include a `hasMore` field that indicates if there are more objects to be iterated over.


<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.oneslipstream.com/v1/consumers?limit=2 \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer sk_test_***" 
```
</RequestExample>
